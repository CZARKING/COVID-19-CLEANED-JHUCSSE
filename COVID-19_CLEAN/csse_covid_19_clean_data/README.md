# Clean JHU CSSE Data (csse_covid_19_clean_data)

This folder contains the latest data from JHU CSSE in .Rdata format. One file, i.e., **CSSE_DailyReports.Rdata**, concatenates their daily reports; `Date_Published` identifies the csv file behind each daily report. The second file, i.e., **CSSE_TimeSeries.Rdata**,  contains the latest time series data. Both files are presented in long rather than wide format. 

Data will be updates to reflect the latest updates from JHU CSSE.
